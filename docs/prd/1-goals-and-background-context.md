# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals
- Provide fast scam analysis that returns a risk score and explanation for SMS text or phone call inputs.
- Empower users to take safe next steps with clear suggested actions based on the scan results.
- Expand the shared scam intelligence database through community reporting of new incidents.
- Maintain a trustworthy experience that protects user data while integrating with third-party AI services.

## 1.2 Background Context
The Prism project addresses the increasing volume of SMS and phone-call scams targeting broad consumer groups, including vulnerable populations. Today, individuals lack an accessible way to evaluate suspicious communications, creating uncertainty and risk. Prism combines predefined detection rules, AI-powered classification, and an evolving database of known scam keywords and numbers to deliver accurate, explainable results in under three seconds. By allowing users to submit new scam reports, the system continually expands its coverage and offers the broader community a reliable first line of defense.
